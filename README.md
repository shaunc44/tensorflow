# Steps to Building Your First Neural Network  

### 1. Load your dataset  

### 2. Set the features and labels  
  * Features = input  
  * Label = prediction  

### 3. Pre-process the dataset  
  * Cannot feed **text** data into the neural network (NN)  
  * Need to change text data to numeric data  
  * Sometime need to change numerical data so the NN will accept it  

### 4. Create training and testing data
  * Training data = used to train the data
  * Testing data = is model capable of predicting the right labels  

### 5. Define the model structure  
  * Input layer >> Hidden layer >> Output layer  
  * Deep learning refers to multiple hidden layers  
  * More hidden layers takes longer to train the neural network

### 6. Train the model  
  * Training the model refers to the calculation of connections between the input layer and hidden layer  
  * **Adjust the weights of the inputs to make better predictions (labels)**  

### 7. Test the model  
  * Goal is to predict the test data  

### 8. Predict the future  
  * User other data sets to make predictions
